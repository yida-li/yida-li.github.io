Concordia Team Design Mini-Capstone â€“ April 2021

Create an android app in java and electric circuitry with smoke/humidity sensors that interacts with one another
Sensors are able to detect and measure intensities of smoke in a household, store and view the data through
Bluetooth to the mobile phone in a SQL local database. After reaching a certain threshold, the fan will activate/disactivate and
a notification will be sent to the phone.
